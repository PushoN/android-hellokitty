Copyright Notice
================

Hello Kitty is a copyrighted trademark of Sanrio Co. Ltd. Meaning I do not know exactly
how usage of "Hello Kitty" should be considered. Quick Google search revealed tons of unauthorized
usage of Hello Kitty images made by other people plus sites containing Hello Kitty images.
There are also a few dozen Hello Kitty applications on Android Market out of which I do not
know whether they are authorized by Sanrio Co. Ltd. or not. And all this leaves me a bit
puzzled has Hello Kitty been protected to the extreme no one should use it without their
approval.

In any case. Shall Sanrio ask me to remove any mentions of Hello Kitty for copyright and/or
trademark infringements, I will rename the application and come up with a different image
for the application.
